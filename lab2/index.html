			<h1> HELLO WORLD </h1>

				<p> 

					<p> Hey! This is Precious the APGM student. In my section today, I got help from Mason to build
						 my website. She was very nice and gave me alot of insight for lab 2.
						Yeah, I enjoyed my time working on the webiste, she is very mindful and tries to figure out the 
						problem. Now I have a better understanding adding things to my site.I think I am getting 
						the hang of this. As for my troubles-I think a problem I experince with was finding a 
						partner in this class,
						This is because most people already found one to work on their assignments
						together with, so it has been quite hard to deal with work on your own and trying
						to find a person to problem solve with. I also think its kind of sad how
						no partner can effect your assignment performace.  
						I tried to solve it asking the TA, being on discord, or get help from
					my classmates, But regardless it can still be a bit of a hassle. To be honest, This assignmnet kind of overwhelmed me. 
					When I saw we had 3 things due on the same day. I was like- gosh how 
					do I even get started on all of these assignments. But 
					once I got started on it. I realized it was not so bad,
					I just needed reassurance from the TA and a classmate
					to understand what to do. And even asked questions on discord how I 
					can make my site better. I think it's going well now. 
					 I put postive energy into this assignment! <p>
