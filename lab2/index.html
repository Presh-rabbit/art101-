					<h2>Precious intoduction</h2>
					<p>In my section today, I got help and ideas from Mason to build
						my website. She was very nice and gave me alot of insight for lab 2.
						Yeah, I enjoyed my time working on the webiste, she is very mindful and 
						tries to figure out the problem. 
						Now I have a better understanding adding things to my site.
					I think I am getting the hang of this.

					 Hi my name is Precious, I am a 4th yr APGM major intrested in UX UI. 
					 I come from Sacramento. I like to make digital art, use figma, and try
					cultrual foods. I am an open minded person and stay postive. I like both
					STEM and art. My favorite cartoon character is Chiikawa and I am obbsessed
					with collecting cute small figures for my mini garden. I am also constanly looking
				at memes</p>

					<h2>My troubles</h2>
					<p>I think a problem I experince with was finding a partner in this class,
						This is because most people already found one to work on their assignments
						together with, so it has been quite hard to deal with work on your own and trying
						to find a person to problem solve with. I also think its kind of sad how
						no partner can effect your assignment performace.  
						I tried to solve it asking the TA, being on discord, or get help from
					my classmates, But regardless it can still be a bit of a hassle.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>My reflection</h2>
					<p> To be honest, This assignmnet kind of overwhelmed me. 
						When I saw we had 3 things due on the same day. I was like- gosh how 
						do I even get started on all of these assignments. But 
						once I got started on it. I realized it wasnt so bad,
						I just needed reassurance from the TA and a classmate
						to understand what to do. And even asked questions on discord how I 
						can make my site better. I think it's going well now. 
						 I put postive energy into this assignment.</p>
