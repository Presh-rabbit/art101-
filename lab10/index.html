					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Today I am working on lab 10. My partner and I worked on this. For this lab we must create a javascript file
						and make a function that would be able to generate random fake dialouge. Our site must be clickable and make random text.
					</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Problems and reflection for this lab, A probelem I ran into was trying to figure out how to make my randome generated text show up.
						My reflection is I did feel a bit confused at first when starting the lab since there was no visuals. But I manage to get a good idea 
						from the wesmodes github labs that were listed. A visual page of the lab always helps me out. That way I can make it look a bit similar 
						to what the description is looking for.  
					</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>

					<div> 
						<p> My generated dialouge should be shown here! Fixing my javascript and css make my assignment work. I am glad things turned out that way.
