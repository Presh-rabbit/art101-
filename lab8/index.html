					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Hi, this is Precious and Miki, for this challenge we are going to learn how to experiment with anonymous fuctions 
						and callbacks. A problem I had to deal with was anxiousness since the 
						repitition and fast paced due dates are starting to bug me. But regardless, I did my best with the lab.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>My reflection from this lab was intresting. Props to those who work on campus and also do the 
						assignment, cause these labs can be overwhelming for me. It's like I finish one and I have to do another one that is due a 
					day later. It's not even funny anymore, even though I am still enjoying how html, css, and js work. </p>
