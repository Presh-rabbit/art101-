					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Hi, this is Precious and Miki, for this challenge we are going to learn how to experiment with anonymous fuctions 
						and callbacks. A problem I had to deal with was with my lab.js, I followed the directions for the lab and it was not hard to follow.
						But the result was the only thing I had trouble with. Every time I save and open my page and check my console. My console shows up
						my array results but they are weirdly shown with labels of index. Not the typical array format. It still shows my array that I listed 
						but I am unsure why it came out that way.
					</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>My reflection from this lab was interesting. It was so hard to get the result I wanted and had to turn in later. I was stuggling but When I finally got
						the array I wanted. I was a bit satisfied, but I put in effort for the outcome. Sorry for the late turn in. </p>
