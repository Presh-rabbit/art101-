					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> Hi, this is is Precious and Miki, My Partner and were feeling a bit challenged since we started on the lab on sunday.
						 I was trying to figure out how to use javascript, since
						it's a new subject for me. It's all new and that's what makes it challenging. And as for problems, I think the problem was to add
						 the car picture to my page.
						 This is because I remember half of it only showing. So I had to play around with
						it. That way it can show the whole car in the page. I don't think I went through any other troubles, but I did have fun learning 
					and making my page using html,css,and finally JS!

						glad I am getting my hands on it. I learned to add JS console on the browser and later on added them on VScode. I feel accomplished after finsihing
					this lab. </p>
