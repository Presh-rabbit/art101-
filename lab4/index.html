					<h2>Challenge</h2> 

			<p>Hi this is Precious and For this challenge I am partnering up with Miki Foster, The challenge
			 is to add psuedocodes before you start to code. It is good practice to try this as it will create a list
					of anything. For example: every day tasks, or how to build a sandwich.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I think a problem I was trying to figure out, was to come up with an something to use for 
						the everyday task for task 1. My partner and I thought that this assignment wouldn't go so 
						hard on us since we are only writing up psuedocodes.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> We put alot of effort into this assignmnet. I added image and changed the color of my lab 4 to make it look presentable. And also did my psuedocodes
						for task 1 and 2. And followed the directions for 3 and 4.  </p>
