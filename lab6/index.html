					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Hi this is Precious and Miki. I worked with my partner to experiment basic javascript data type and variables. My challenge was learning how to use JS for 
						lab 6. It was a bit difficult now. Since I am more unfamilar with it. 
						And as for Problems, I think the directions made me confused because of the wording at first. Also adding
					myMainRide or myTransport got me confused for a second too. It got me confused because I did not know which one to start with it. Other than being more 
				familar with using console.log or let in the beginning of learning JS. But at the very end, I figured it out all on my own. So glad it turned
			out that way. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> The image desribes how I felt working in this lab, Literally my reaction. I believe that I have added in some effort into this, 
						It was difficult for me because I was a bit lost with the wording of the 
						assignment since our the professor wants us to think instead of following and copying the directions like so. </p>
