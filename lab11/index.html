					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Today I am working on lab 11 javascript events and forms. For this lab my partner and I had to create a a html
						for our lab and work on a javascript to add to out lab. I think the lab was a little similar to the one in the past 
						when we had to type a random name and it would genterate it into a new word using the same letters. Which is really
						cool.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>For this reflection I enjoyed working and learning javascript events and forms. 
						I did have a hard time with the lab.js because I was trying to make it show up on my page. But turns
						out I didnt save it and have been opening a page of my old progess.
