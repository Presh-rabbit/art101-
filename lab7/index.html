					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Hi this is Precious and Miki. For this challenge we are working on lab 7. We are trying to 
                        add or create a new function in our file. A problem I ran into was creating my first lab
                         without templete all on my own and also trying to understand the 2nd task. This is because I
						was unsure if the task meant to make me add a mixed name and then afterwards write the name but arraged correctly.
					My partner caught my mistake on that task and told me to try to take off the mixed name and 
				write "enter your name". Which worked! I am so glad I got this sorted out.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> For my reflection, I felt a bit challenged because I had to work on this last night trying to figure 
                        out how to create my first lab without the templete. Sure, I felt preesure towards the deadline but I was in the right track into
					getting this lab finished. The only thing that caught me off gaurd was writing the name. As the directions of the task confused me.</p>
