			<div class="special-sections" id="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> For this challenge we are covering Libaries and jQuery. I learned that we had to create our own html and list down challenges, problems,
                        and our reflections. This is a good way to organize our thoughts about what we'll cover for jQuery.

            <div class="special-sections" id="Problems">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p> A problem I ran into was trying to load my page. I think I might have wrote something wrong on my code for the html part. So I kept 
                    playing around with it until I got it working again. I also had a problem being unsure if I did the Jquery part correctly on my lab.js on
                lab 9. I was concerned if it needed to show up on my page or just the console. </p>

		<div class="special-sections" id= "reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> As for my reflection, It was alot of work to deal with in my perspective. Since we had to create our html all on our own, without
                        a templete. I just needed to have big motivation and alot of focus to get this lab done. I did try my best and I am glad my work is 
                        done now. I had a hard time with the buttons tho.
